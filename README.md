# NPM Package linting

Performs sanity checks on a package tarball and `package.json`.

> npx npm-pkg-lint

## Usage

> npx npm-pkg-lint [--tarball my-pkg-1.2.3.tgz} [--pkgfile package.json]

Use `--tarball` and `--pkgfile` to specify custom locations.
Default is to find `package.json` from current directory tree and derive tarball filename from the `name` and `version` field.

## Disallowed files

Disallows certain files from being included in the package tarball.

**Why?** They serve no purpose for the end user and makes the download larger and unpacking takes more time (which for a single package might be insignificant but with thousands of dependencies can cause delays)

- Test coverage and reports
- Unittests
- Lint configs (eslint, prettier, html-validate, etc)
- Webpack configs (webpack.config.js)
- CI-related files (github actions, gitlab pipelines, etc)
- Typescript configs (tsconfig)
- Editor-related files
